## Development Guide

### Key Implementation Patterns

1. **Leverage the Agents SDK**:
   - Use built-in SDK capabilities whenever possible
   - Extend SDK classes rather than building from scratch
   - Follow SDK patterns for WebSockets, state management, and tools

2. **Memory Management Principles**:
   - Leverage the Agents SDK's built-in SQL database (`this.sql`)
   - Use the state management system (`this.setState`, `this.state`)
   - Keep raw memory separate from processed insights
   - Follow the patterns established in the `MemoryManager` class

3. **Tool Integration Principles**:
   - Use the Agents SDK tool system for defining and executing tools
   - Follow the MCP-First approach - prefer external services via MCP adapters
   - Implement tools with both automatic execution and confirmation patterns
   - Extend the `BaseMCPAdapter` class for new service integrations

### Development Process

1. **Feature Planning**:
   - Check the roadmap to ensure alignment with project priorities
   - Create an issue describing the feature or bug
   - Design interfaces and data flows before implementation
   - Discuss complex changes with maintainers

2. **Testing & Validation Strategy**:
   - Follow the testing pyramid approach (unit, integration, E2E tests)
   - Aim for >85% test coverage for core business logic
   - Write tests before implementation for critical components (test-first development)
   - Use Vitest for unit and integration testing
   - Implement proper mocking strategies for dependencies
   - Run tests automatically on every commit via CI
   - Prioritize coverage for critical components (memory system, knowledge graph, tool integration)

3. **Implementation Guidelines**:
   - Follow test-driven development with Vitest
   - Organize code with one responsibility per file
   - Define clear interfaces for module boundaries
   - Minimize coupling between modules
   - Include comprehensive comments explaining the "why"
   - Follow established patterns in existing implementations

3. **Pull Request Process**:
   - Create a branch using the format `feature/feature-name` or `fix/issue-description`
   - Keep changes focused on a single feature or fix
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting
   - Include a clear description of changes and reference related issues
   - Get at least one code review
   - Squash and merge to the target branch
