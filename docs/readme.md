# ImpossibleAgent Documentation

## Important Notice

**The primary source of project documentation has moved to the `/memory-bank` directory.**

The `/memory-bank` directory serves as the single source of truth for all internal development information, containing comprehensive technical details, implementation decisions, and project context. It is continuously updated with all project changes and is intended for the development team and AI assistants.

## Public Documentation

This `/docs` directory has been streamlined to provide concise, high-level documentation for external developers, users, and stakeholders. Instead of maintaining multiple detailed files, we now provide a single comprehensive overview document:

- [**project-overview.md**](./project-overview.md) - A complete but concise overview of the ImpossibleAgent project, including its architecture, key features, and development workflow.

This approach ensures that external viewers can quickly understand the project without being overwhelmed by implementation details, while the memory bank maintains all the detailed information needed for development.

## Documentation Update Process

1. **For internal development information**:
   - Update the appropriate files in the `/memory-bank` directory
   - Ensure all implementation details, decisions, and context are captured

2. **For public-facing documentation**:
   - Update the project-overview.md file in this `/docs` directory
   - Focus on clarity, usability, and accessibility for external audiences
   - Ensure consistency with the information in the Memory Bank

## Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Maintain a consistent style and terminology
- Include diagrams for complex concepts (using Mermaid or similar)
- Date all documentation updates
- Include version information where relevant

## Developer Reference

For developers who need detailed implementation guidance, we maintain the following reference document:

- [**sdk-implementation-guide.md**](./sdk-implementation-guide.md) - Detailed implementation guide with code examples and technical specifics for developers working with the Cloudflare Agents SDK.
