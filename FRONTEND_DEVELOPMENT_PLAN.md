### Development Milestones
1. Execute tools and display results using SDK's tool patterns
2. Connect external services via OAuth
3. Show conversation context and memory references
4. Navigate conversation history with preserved context
5. Adapt UI based on conversation context

## Phase 3: Multi-Device Experience (Months 3-4)

Focus on expanding to multiple platforms while maintaining state through the SDK.

- [ ] Add voice input integration

### Desktop Application Foundation
- [ ] Create Electron application with Agents SDK client
- [ ] Implement system tray integration
- [ ] Add global keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Create local file system integration
- [ ] Integrate with OS notification systems

### Cross-Device Enhancements
- [ ] Use agent naming for session continuity across devices
- [ ] Implement "Continue on device X" functionality
- [ ] Create synchronized notification management
- [ ] Ensure consistent theme and preferences
- [ ] Add device-aware response formatting

### Development Milestones
1. Launch minimal viable mobile application
2. Launch minimal viable desktop application
3. Successfully transfer sessions between devices using agent id
4. Synchronize notifications across platforms
5. Maintain consistent experience with device-specific enhancements

## Phase 4: Advanced Interaction & Personalization (Months 4-6)

Add sophisticated interaction capabilities as the agent's capabilities mature.

### Advanced Interaction Features
- [ ] Enhance voice interaction capabilities
- [ ] Create rich media messaging components
- [x] Build memory visualization components
- [ ] Implement document collaboration features
- [ ] Add contextual suggestions UI

### Personalization Features
- [ ] Develop preference management UI
- [ ] Create agent personality customization options
- [ ] Build visualization of learned preferences
- [x] Implement memory management interface
- [ ] Create personal data insights dashboard

### Development Milestones
1. Support multiple interaction modalities (text, voice, rich media)
2. Implement visualization for complex data
3. Create preference and personalization UI
4. Build memory management controls
5. Develop insights visualization dashboard

## Phase 5: Production Refinement & Performance (Month 6+)

Focus on production readiness, performance optimization, and refinement.

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Add graceful degradation strategies
- [ ] Complete cross-browser/device testing
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance
- [ ] Add internationalization support

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize bundle size for client applications
- [ ] Improve rendering performance
- [ ] Optimize network requests
- [ ] Reduce battery usage for mobile applications
- [ ] Optimize memory usage

### Experience Refinement
- [ ] Polish animations and transitions
- [ ] Enhance interaction feedback
- [ ] Improve onboarding experience
- [ ] Optimize first-time user experience
- [ ] Add power user features

### Development Milestones
1. Pass performance benchmarks on all platforms
2. Achieve accessibility compliance
3. Support key international markets
4. Optimize startup and interaction times
5. Refine and polish all user flows

## Integration with Backend Development

Frontend development phases are designed to align with the backend roadmap, both utilizing the Cloudflare Agents SDK:

1. **Phase 1 Frontend** aligns with the base Agent implementation on the backend
2. **Phase 2 Frontend** aligns with the Tool Integration implementation
3. **Phase 3 Frontend** aligns with the Multi-Device Session management
4. **Phase 4 Frontend** aligns with Knowledge & Memory extensions
5. **Phase 5 Frontend** aligns with Security and advanced features

## Key Implementation Guidelines

### SDK Integration
- Maximize use of the `useAgent` and `useAgentChat` hooks from the SDK
- Extend the starter template UI components rather than building from scratch
- Use the SDK's WebSocket capabilities for real-time updates
- Leverage the SDK's state synchronization for cross-device experiences

### State Management
- Use the SDK's built-in state synchronization for most app state
- Add client-side state only for UI-specific needs
- Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback capability
- Cache appropriately based on data type and sensitivity

### Cross-Platform Strategy
- Use the SDK's core client capabilities as a foundation across platforms
- Create platform-specific adapters around the core SDK
- Maintain consistent interaction patterns while respecting platform conventions

### Progressive Enhancement
- Core conversation functionality should work on all supported platforms
- Advanced features should gracefully degrade on less capable platforms
- Ensure offline functionality provides essential experience

### Performance Targets
- Initial load under 2 seconds on typical connections
- Response to user input under 100ms
- Smooth animations at 60fps
- Background sync with minimal battery impact

### Security Best Practices
- No sensitive data in client-side storage without encryption
- Token-based authentication with secure refresh mechanisms
- Clear permission management for all tool integrations
- Transparent indication of data transmission and storage
