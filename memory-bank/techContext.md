## Tool Usage Patterns

### MCP Adapter Pattern

```typescript
// Base adapter pattern for all MCP integrations
export abstract class BaseMCPAdapter<Env> {
  constructor(protected agent: Agent<Env>) {}
  
  abstract initialize(): Promise<void>;
  abstract getTools(): Tool[];
  abstract executeToolCall(toolCall: ToolCall): Promise<ToolResult>;
  
  protected async registerTools(): Promise<void> {
    const tools = this.getTools();
    // Register tools with the agent
  }
}

// Implementation example
export class WeatherAdapter<Env> extends BaseMCPAdapter<Env> {
  async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    // Initialize the adapter
    await this.registerTools();
  }
  
  getTools(): Tool[] {
    return [
      {
        name: "getWeather",
        description: "Get weather information for a location",
        // Tool definition
      }
    ];
  }
  
  async executeToolCall(toolCall: ToolCall): Promise<ToolResult> {
    // Execute the tool call
    // Return the result
  }
}
```

### Tool Suggestion Pattern

```typescript
// Tool suggestion flow
export class ToolSuggestionSystem<Env> {
  constructor(private agent: Agent<Env>) {}
  
  async suggestTools(context: ToolSuggestionContext): Promise<ContextualToolSuggestion[]> {
    // Analyze conversation context
    const analyzedContext = await this.analyzeConversationContext(context.conversation);
    
    // Get base tool suggestions
    const baseSuggestions = await this.discoveryManager.suggestTools({
      query: context.query,
      // Additional parameters
    });
    
    // Enhance with context relevance
    const contextualSuggestions = await this.enhanceSuggestionsWithContext(
      baseSuggestions,
      analyzedContext
    );
    
    // Apply user preferences
    const filteredSuggestions = this.applyUserPreferences(
      contextualSuggestions,
      context.preferences
    );
    
    // Return top suggestions
    return filteredSuggestions.slice(0, 5);
  }
}
```
