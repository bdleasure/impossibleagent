   - Trade-offs: Loses UI components but gains maintainability and focus

2. **SDK Update Strategy**:
   - Decision: Implement comprehensive cleanup scripts for future SDK updates
   - Rationale: The base Cloudflare Agents SDK includes many frontend files and dependencies by default
   - Implementation: Created scripts to remove frontend components, clean up dependencies, and reinstall node_modules

3. **Build Process**:
   - Decision: Use wrangler for building and deployment
   - Rationale: Simplifies the build process and aligns with Cloudflare Workers deployment
   - Implementation: Added build script to package.json using wrangler deploy --dry-run

4. **Documentation**:
   - Decision: Create comprehensive documentation for the cleanup process
   - Rationale: Ensures future developers understand the project structure and update process
   - Implementation: Created FRONTEND-CLEANUP-README.md and memory-bank/frontend-cleanup.md

### Tool Usage Tracking Design Decisions

1. **SQL-Based Storage**:
   - Decision: Use SQL tables for storing usage data rather than a NoSQL approach
   - Rationale: SQL provides structured storage with query capabilities, relationships between data can be explicitly modeled, and it's built into the Agents SDK
   - Trade-offs: Less flexibility for schema changes, but better query performance and data integrity

2. **Real-time vs. Batch Aggregation**:
   - Decision: Implement both real-time updates for critical statistics and scheduled batch aggregation
   - Rationale: Real-time updates provide immediate feedback for tool suggestions, while batch aggregation optimizes performance for comprehensive analytics
   - Implementation: Daily scheduled task for full aggregation, real-time updates for frequently accessed statistics

3. **Circular Dependency Resolution**:
   - Decision: Implement proper mocking strategies to break circular references in tests
   - Rationale: ToolUsageTracker and ToolSuggestionSystem have a circular dependency that needed to be resolved for testing
   - Implementation: Used vi.mock to create mock implementations of classes

4. **Privacy Considerations**:
   - Decision: Store sanitized input parameters to protect sensitive information
   - Rationale: Tool usage tracking should not compromise user privacy
   - Implementation: Sanitize sensitive data before storing in the database

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization

1. **Class Structure**:
   - Each major component has its own class
   - Classes are organized by functionality (tools, memory, knowledge)
   - Interfaces are defined for all data structures
   - Generic types are used for agent environment

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - PascalCase for classes and interfaces
   - camelCase for methods and properties
   - Descriptive names that indicate functionality
   - Consistent prefixing for related components

3. **File Organization**:
   - One class per file
   - Files organized by feature area
   - Clear separation between different system components
   - Consistent import ordering

### Implementation Patterns

1. **Initialization Pattern**:
   - Components have an `initialize()` method
   - Database tables created during initialization
   - Connections to dependencies established
   - Scheduled tasks registered

2. **Tracking Pattern**:
   - Start tracking with context information
   - Return a function to end tracking with success/failure
   - Record detailed event data
   - Update aggregates for frequently accessed statistics

3. **Query Pattern**:
   - Flexible query options with filters
   - Pagination support
   - Sorting capabilities
   - Default values for common queries

### Testing Approach

1. **Mock Dependencies**:
   - Use vi.mock for external dependencies
   - Create mock implementations of classes
   - Avoid circular references in tests
   - Test components in isolation

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Unit tests for all public methods
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Test both success and failure paths
   - Verify edge cases and error handling

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights

1. **SQL Schema Design**:
   - Proper indexing is critical for query performance
   - Consider both read and write patterns when designing tables
   - Use JSON for flexible metadata storage
   - Create aggregate tables for frequently accessed statistics

2. **Tool Integration**:
   - Clear separation between tool discovery, suggestion, and execution
   - Context-aware suggestions improve user experience
   - Tool usage tracking provides valuable insights
   - Standardized interfaces simplify adding new tools

3. **Testing Strategies**:
   - Mocking is essential for testing components with dependencies
   - Circular dependencies require special handling in tests
   - Test both the happy path and error conditions
   - Use realistic test data for meaningful results

### Project Management Insights

1. **Documentation Importance**:
   - Keeping documentation in sync with implementation is critical
   - Document design decisions and rationales
   - Update roadmap and implementation status after completing features
   - Clear documentation helps new contributors understand the system

2. **Incremental Development**:
   - Building features incrementally allows for earlier feedback
   - Start with core functionality and add enhancements
   - Test each component thoroughly before integration
   - Regular updates to project documentation help track progress

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Be aware of circular dependencies between components
   - Design interfaces to minimize coupling
   - Consider dependency injection for better testability
   - Document component relationships for clarity

4. **SDK Management**:
   - The base Cloudflare Agents SDK includes many frontend components by default
   - Updates to the SDK may reintroduce frontend components
   - Cleanup scripts are essential for maintaining a backend-focused project
   - Document the update process for future developers
