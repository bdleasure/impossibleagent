# ImpossibleAgent Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the ImpossibleAgent project is on implementing and enhancing the **Tool Usage Tracking** system, which has been successfully completed as of May 8, 2025. This system provides comprehensive analytics and tracking for tool usage patterns, enabling improved tool suggestions and user experience. With this implementation complete, the project is now shifting focus to developing **Advanced UI Components**, particularly the Tool Usage Analytics Dashboard to leverage the newly implemented tracking capabilities.

The project has also made significant progress on the **Memory System**, **Knowledge Graph**, **Cross-Device Session Management**, **Security System**, and **Offline Capabilities** components, which form the foundation of the agent's capabilities. These systems are fully implemented and integrated with the core agent functionality, providing a robust foundation for future enhancements.

## Recent Changes

### Centralized Error Handling Implementation

The Centralized Error Handling system has been implemented as of May 9, 2025, providing a comprehensive framework for error management throughout the application:

1. **Error Class Hierarchy**:

   - Analyzes usage by time (hour of day, day of week), user, and context (intents, topics)
   - Identifies trending tools and generates personalized recommendations
   - Tracks success/failure rates and execution times for performance analysis
   - Implements `startTracking` method that returns a function to end tracking with success/failure info
   - Provides methods for retrieving tool-specific and user-specific usage statistics
   - Generates tool recommendations based on historical usage patterns and user preferences
   - Schedules daily aggregation tasks for performance optimization
   - Integrates with ToolSuggestionSystem for improved context-aware suggestions

2. **SQL Schema Design**:
   - `tool_usage_events` table for individual usage events with detailed tracking information
   - `tool_usage_aggregates` table for tool-specific statistics with aggregated metrics
   - `user_tool_usage_stats` table for user-specific statistics and preferences

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Tool Usage Tracking Design Decisions

1. **SQL-Based Storage**:
   - Decision: Use SQL tables for storing usage data rather than a NoSQL approach
   - Rationale: SQL provides structured storage with query capabilities, relationships between data can be explicitly modeled, and it's built into the Agents SDK
   - Trade-offs: Less flexibility for schema changes, but better query performance and data integrity

2. **Real-time vs. Batch Aggregation**:
   - Decision: Implement both real-time updates for critical statistics and scheduled batch aggregation
   - Rationale: Real-time updates provide immediate feedback for tool suggestions, while batch aggregation optimizes performance for comprehensive analytics
   - Implementation: Daily scheduled task for full aggregation, real-time updates for frequently accessed statistics

3. **Circular Dependency Resolution**:
   - Decision: Implement proper mocking strategies to break circular references in tests
   - Rationale: ToolUsageTracker and ToolSuggestionSystem have a circular dependency that needed to be resolved for testing
   - Implementation: Used vi.mock to create mock implementations of classes

4. **Privacy Considerations**:
   - Decision: Store sanitized input parameters to protect sensitive information
   - Rationale: Tool usage tracking should not compromise user privacy
   - Implementation: Sanitize sensitive data before storing in the database

### UI Component Priorities

1. **Tool Usage Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Priority: High
   - Rationale: Provides immediate value from the newly implemented tracking system
   - Key features: Usage statistics, trending tools, success/failure rates
   - Design inspiration: VS Code's clean, dark-themed interface with clear data visualization
   - Implementation approach: Use chart.js or D3.js for visualizations within Card components

2. **Tool Suggestion UI**:
   - Priority: High
   - Rationale: Leverages the enhanced suggestion capabilities from the tracking system
   - Key features: Context-aware suggestions, parameter input forms
   - Design inspiration: VS Code's MCP server cards with clear visual hierarchy
   - Implementation approach: Create reusable ToolCard components with consistent styling

3. **Voice Interaction Components**:
   - Priority: Medium
   - Rationale: Expands interaction modalities but depends on tool integration UI
   - Key features: Voice input, audio feedback
   - Design inspiration: Minimal UI indicators for voice activity and processing
   - Implementation approach: Use Web Speech API with visual feedback indicators

4. **Rich Media Messaging**:
   - Priority: Medium
   - Rationale: Enhances content display but depends on core UI components
   - Key features: Media display, interactive elements
   - Design inspiration: VS Code's markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
   - Implementation approach: Extend existing memoized-markdown component with media support

5. **Context Explorer**:
   - Priority: High (New)
   - Rationale: Replaces traditional chat history with context-aware navigation
   - Key features: Topic clusters, knowledge graph navigation, memory exploration
   - Design inspiration: VS Code's sidebar navigation with expandable sections
   - Implementation approach: Create hierarchical navigation component with memory integration

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization

1. **Class Structure**:
   - Each major component has its own class
   - Classes are organized by functionality (tools, memory, knowledge)
   - Interfaces are defined for all data structures
   - Generic types are used for agent environment

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - PascalCase for classes and interfaces
   - camelCase for methods and properties
   - Descriptive names that indicate functionality
   - Consistent prefixing for related components

3. **File Organization**:
   - One class per file
   - Files organized by feature area
   - Clear separation between different system components
   - Consistent import ordering

### Implementation Patterns

1. **Initialization Pattern**:
   - Components have an `initialize()` method
   - Database tables created during initialization
   - Connections to dependencies established
   - Scheduled tasks registered

2. **Tracking Pattern**:
   - Start tracking with context information
   - Return a function to end tracking with success/failure
   - Record detailed event data
   - Update aggregates for frequently accessed statistics

3. **Query Pattern**:
   - Flexible query options with filters
   - Pagination support
   - Sorting capabilities
   - Default values for common queries

### Testing Approach

1. **Mock Dependencies**:
   - Use vi.mock for external dependencies
   - Create mock implementations of classes
   - Avoid circular references in tests
   - Test components in isolation

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Unit tests for all public methods
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Test both success and failure paths
