# ImpossibleAgent Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the ImpossibleAgent project is on implementing and enhancing the **Tool Usage Tracking** system, which has been successfully completed as of May 8, 2025. This system provides comprehensive analytics and tracking for tool usage patterns, enabling improved tool suggestions and user experience. With this implementation complete, the project is now shifting focus to developing **Advanced UI Components**, particularly the Tool Usage Analytics Dashboard to leverage the newly implemented tracking capabilities.

The project has also made significant progress on the **Memory System**, **Knowledge Graph**, **Cross-Device Session Management**, **Security System**, and **Offline Capabilities** components, which form the foundation of the agent's capabilities. These systems are fully implemented and integrated with the core agent functionality, providing a robust foundation for future enhancements.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Tool Usage Tracking Design Decisions

1. **SQL-Based Storage**:
   - Decision: Use SQL tables for storing usage data rather than a NoSQL approach
   - Rationale: SQL provides structured storage with query capabilities, relationships between data can be explicitly modeled, and it's built into the Agents SDK
   - Trade-offs: Less flexibility for schema changes, but better query performance and data integrity

2. **Real-time vs. Batch Aggregation**:
   - Decision: Implement both real-time updates for critical statistics and scheduled batch aggregation
   - Rationale: Real-time updates provide immediate feedback for tool suggestions, while batch aggregation optimizes performance for comprehensive analytics
   - Implementation: Daily scheduled task for full aggregation, real-time updates for frequently accessed statistics

3. **Circular Dependency Resolution**:
   - Decision: Implement proper mocking strategies to break circular references in tests
   - Rationale: ToolUsageTracker and ToolSuggestionSystem have a circular dependency that needed to be resolved for testing
   - Implementation: Used vi.mock to create mock implementations of classes

4. **Privacy Considerations**:
   - Decision: Store sanitized input parameters to protect sensitive information
   - Rationale: Tool usage tracking should not compromise user privacy
   - Implementation: Sanitize sensitive data before storing in the database

### UI Component Priorities

1. **Tool Usage Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Priority: High
   - Rationale: Provides immediate value from the newly implemented tracking system
   - Key features: Usage statistics, trending tools, success/failure rates

2. **Tool Suggestion UI**:
   - Priority: High
   - Rationale: Leverages the enhanced suggestion capabilities from the tracking system
   - Key features: Context-aware suggestions, parameter input forms

3. **Voice Interaction Components**:
   - Priority: Medium
   - Rationale: Expands interaction modalities but depends on tool integration UI
   - Key features: Voice input, audio feedback

4. **Rich Media Messaging**:
   - Priority: Medium
   - Rationale: Enhances content display but depends on core UI components
   - Key features: Media display, interactive elements

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization

1. **Class Structure**:
   - Each major component has its own class
   - Classes are organized by functionality (tools, memory, knowledge)
   - Interfaces are defined for all data structures
   - Generic types are used for agent environment

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - PascalCase for classes and interfaces
   - camelCase for methods and properties
   - Descriptive names that indicate functionality
   - Consistent prefixing for related components

3. **File Organization**:
   - One class per file
   - Files organized by feature area
   - Clear separation between different system components
   - Consistent import ordering

### Implementation Patterns

1. **Initialization Pattern**:
   - Components have an `initialize()` method
   - Database tables created during initialization
   - Connections to dependencies established
   - Scheduled tasks registered

2. **Tracking Pattern**:
   - Start tracking with context information
   - Return a function to end tracking with success/failure
   - Record detailed event data
   - Update aggregates for frequently accessed statistics

3. **Query Pattern**:
   - Flexible query options with filters
   - Pagination support
   - Sorting capabilities
   - Default values for common queries

### Testing Approach

1. **Mock Dependencies**:
   - Use vi.mock for external dependencies
   - Create mock implementations of classes
   - Avoid circular references in tests
   - Test components in isolation

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Unit tests for all public methods
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Test both success and failure paths
   - Verify edge cases and error handling
