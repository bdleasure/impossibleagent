## Implementation Priorities

Based on our current progress, the implementation priorities are now:

1. âœ… **Core Agent Implementation** - Extended the SDK's `AIChatAgent` class
2. âœ… **Memory Management** - Built on the SDK's SQL capabilities
3. âœ… **Tool Integration** - Implemented using the SDK's tool system
4. ðŸ”œ **Client Extensions** - Enhancing SDK's React hooks
5. âœ… **Security Features** - Added `SecurityManager` with access control
6. ðŸ”œ **Knowledge Systems** - Building on memory capabilities
7. ðŸ”œ **Multi-Platform Support** - Extending to multiple devices

Current focus areas:
1. **Enhance Memory Retrieval** - Implement more sophisticated memory retrieval using embeddings
2. **Expand MCP Adapters** - Create additional adapters for more external services
3. **Implement Knowledge Extraction** - Enhance the ability to extract knowledge from conversations

## Alignment with Agents SDK

For developers working on ImpossibleAgent, note these important guidelines:

1. **Leverage SDK Features First**: 
   - Always use built-in SDK capabilities before creating custom solutions
   - Extend SDK classes rather than building from scratch
   - Use the SDK's patterns for WebSockets, state management, and tools

2. **SDK-First Development Approach**:
   - Start with the agents-starter template
   - Build custom functionality as extensions to SDK patterns
   - Always consider how your extensions interact with base SDK features
   - Refer to [SDK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./SDK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for implementation details

3. **Frontend Considerations During Backend Development**:
   - Ensure your backend features expose appropriate methods for frontend consumption
   - Design state structure with React hooks in mind
   - Consider WebSocket hibernation and recovery in your implementations
   - Create callable methods for client-side access

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - After implementing each component, update the corresponding documentation
   - Mark completed items in this roadmap
   - Document any deviations from the SDK patterns
   - Add implementation notes that would help other developers
